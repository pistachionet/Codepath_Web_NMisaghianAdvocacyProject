      <h2>Forums:Weather </h2>
      <h4> &nbsp; Record temperatures and prolonged droughts in 2022 led to sharply reduced crop yields in many regions, with the impact likely to extend through 2023. ‚ÄòHeatflation‚Äô has already become part of the agricultural vernacular, describing how higher temperatures lead to smaller harvests and higher prices. But it is not only extreme heat that hurts crop yields ‚Äì increased and more severe flooding, more frequent landslides and unexpected frost are also damaging.

Agriculture is especially vulnerable to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather-related and climate-induced events.
Weather examples from 2022: The devastating floods in Pakistan from July to October inundated a third of the country and washed away nearly half its crops, at an estimated cost of $2.3bn.3 Vegetable prices initially spiked by 500%. The current drought in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti and Eritrea) has led millions of people to move from the stricken areas in search of food. In Egypt, extreme heat during the summer and extreme cold in the winter have hurt the Nile delta‚Äôs agricultural output, which is the main source of such production for the North African nation. In Europe, record-breaking heatwaves in the UK, France, Italy, Spain and Germany did severe damage to summer crops such as maize, sunflower and soybeans.</h4>

      <h2>News:Helping</h2>
      <h4> &nbsp; Washington, D.C. (Nov 14, 2022)  In a recent poll conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the Better World Campaign and the United Nations Association of the USA (UNA-USA), three-quarters of adults (76%) support the U.S. providing aid to organizations assisting countries suffering from the global food crisis. That number includes 86% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans.

More than two-thirds of the adults polled (71%) agreed that addressing the global food crisis abroad is important for national security here at home, again including majorities of Democrats (83%) and Republicans. (63%)

‚ÄúThis level of bipartisan support shows that Americans understand that a global food crisis creates instability around the world,‚Äù said Peter Yeo, President of the Better World Campaign. ‚ÄúHelping those facing food insecurity not only aligns with our values as Americans, but it‚Äôs the smart thing to do,‚Äù Yeo added.

The World Food Programme estimates that 49 million people in 49 countries ‚Äúare teetering on the edge of famine.‚Äù

More than half of U.S. adults (52%) ranked global organizations such as the UN as ‚Äúwell-positioned‚Äù to solve the global food crisis, with young adults (54%) saying the same.

This poll was conducted between October 7-October 8, 2022 among a sample of 2,210 Adults and an oversample of 1,000 Young adults (18-29 year-olds). Results from the full survey have a margin of error of +/-2 percentage points.
